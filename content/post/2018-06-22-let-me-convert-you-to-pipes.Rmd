My mother (like many mothers) still has an AOL account. I think her reasoning is that AOL was so difficult to learn, investing the effort to learn gmail is just too daunting. I'll leave it at that. 

If you're not using pipes (%>%) in your R code, you basically have an AOL account.

The following sequences are identical in their meaning, but see which one is more human readable: 
````{}
eat(butter(toast(slice(grab(bread)))))

bread %>%
  grab() %>%
  slice() %>%
  toast() %>%
  butter() %>%
  eat()
````

This is the beauty of pipes (and R generally): It let's you think about data in a more human way.
