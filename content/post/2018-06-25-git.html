<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p>There are legions of git guides already on the internet. I am writing this one for my team and myself who are newly collaborating on git. I assume that other newcomers to git collaboration will find it useful. This guide will cover the basics of collaborating and undoing mistakes.</p>

<h2>git revert</h2>
<p>The safest way to restore a previous version of your project is to use <code>git revert 0d1d7fc32</code>, where “0d1d7fc32” represent the hash number of the commit you want restored. If you just want to restore the most recent commit you can use <code>git revert HEAD</code>, which is essentially “UNDO”.<code>IN both cases, git revert &quot;undoes&quot; work by restoring an older commit as the newest commit, while leaving in place any commits that occured between the restored commit and the current commit. In contrast,</code>git reset` would have taken turnedback the clock to the older commit and erased all the “in between commits” in the process.</p>
<p>There are other commands for restoring your project–or files within it–to specific prior states, but <code>git revert</code> is a good place to start.</p>
<p>__ How does git revert behave within a branch?</p>
<p>Atlassian offers an excellent tutorial of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-revert">git revert</a>.</p>
<p>git revert will revert your project without erasing the commits in between your prior commit and the current reversion.</p>
<p>Git revert brings an older commit forward to become the head, but it leaves the commit “in between” in place.</p>
<p>In contrast git reset will move the HEAD back to a prior commit and erase the commits in between.</p>

<p>Extract specific files as they were in a previous commit: <code>git checkout 0d1d7fc32 -- file_name.ext</code></p>
<p>Create a new branch that reflects progress at prior commit:</p>
<p><code>git checkout -b add_feature_x_old 0d1d7fc32</code></p>

<p>Update just your last commit message <code>$ git commit --amend -m &quot;This is the correct message&quot;</code></p>
<p>If you forgot to add some stuff in your last commit: <code>$ git add some/changed/file.ext</code> <code>$ git commit --amend -m &quot;commit message&quot;</code></p>
<p>Restore a local file to its state at a prior commit <code>$ git checkout HEAD file/to/restore.ext</code></p>
<p>Restore a local repo to its state at a prior commit and delete all commits in between:</p>
<p><code>git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32</code></p>

<p>git checkout and git reset, move the HEAD and branch ref pointers to a specified commit.</p>

<h1>Core vocab:</h1>
<p><code>HEAD</code> refers to the project status at the most recent commit in the checked-out branch. Also the commit that the current working tree stemmed from. * If you checkout a branch, HEAD symbolically refers to that branch, indicating that the branch name should be updated after the next commit operation. * If you checkout a specific commit, HEAD refers to that commit only. This is referred to as a <code>detached HEAD</code>, and occurs, for example, if you check out a tag name.</p>
<p>The <code>index</code> (also known as the <code>cache</code> or <code>staging area</code>) is where files are staged via <code>git add</code> before they are committed to the local git repo.</p>
<p>You use <code>git status</code> to see what files are staged in your index and awaiting commit.</p>
<p>A <code>commit</code> is a snapshot of your working tree at a point in time</p>
<p>The files you are directly working upon live in your <code>working directory</code>, <code>project</code>, <code>working tree</code>. These all can mean the same thing.</p>
