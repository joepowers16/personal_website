When choosing where to live so many families fixate on the schools's quality, but take a closer look at what this really measures. In CA school quality is rated on average performance. This is a "better than nothing" metric, but if you have more data on your kid (you better) then you can probably make a better informed choice, and maybe get a better deal on housing. 

For instance RWC has low scores, but they have 40% ESL. What if your kid is ESL, maybe RWC serves these students really well, and MEnlo, which has 2% ESL can't serve them.
