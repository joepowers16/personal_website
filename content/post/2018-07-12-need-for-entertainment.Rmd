My nonfiction reading list has really come together around a common theme this week: The human need for fiction. 

First this video where the anthropologist observes the endless cycle of violence that consumes these New Guineans. But how without this cycle of violence their lives would be unbearably dull. 

Then Sapiens

Then How to Change your Mind

All of these readings, contributed to a sense that entertainment is not a distraction from what is real in life. Rather it is central to life.
