      <description>My nonfiction reading list has really come together around a common theme this week: The human need for fiction.
First this video where the anthropologist observes the endless cycle of violence that consumes these New Guineans. But how without this cycle of violence their lives would be unbearably dull.
Then Sapiens
Then How to Change your Mind
All of these readings, contributed to a sense that entertainment is not a distraction from what is real in life.</description>

      <title>mutating with joins</title>

      <description>So often I want to combine the mutate and filter variables, to change select variables to equal specific values fomr other variables. The best way to do this is through joins. Filter and save the data you want to impute from, join, then your conditional replacement will be a breeze.</description>

      <description>Notice the vector class for the second column in this tibble.
## # A tibble: 4 x 2 ## cyl data ## &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;lt;list&amp;gt; ## 1 4 &amp;lt;tibble [81 × 10]&amp;gt; ## 2 5 &amp;lt;tibble [4 × 10]&amp;gt; ## 3 6 &amp;lt;tibble [79 × 10]&amp;gt; ## 4 8 &amp;lt;tibble [70 × 10]&amp;gt; It’s labelled &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;, indicating that it is a “list column”. When I first learned about list columns I thought, “Neat, but when will I ever use these?</description>

      <description>Within a mutate() I can call map2.
ds_mtcars %&amp;lt;&amp;gt;% mutate(pred = map2(grid, model, add_predictions)) BUt not outside of mutate()
map2(ds_mtcars$file_names, ds_mtcars$plots, ggsave) ds_mtcars %&amp;gt;% map2(file_names, plots, ggsave) </description>

      <description>You should use your current job to qualify yourself for your next job. While you won’t be able to show most of your work publicly. Do give an inkling of what you did by blogging about it. Then you can claim the full scope of teh absrtact work you did at your company.</description>

      <description>Note that map2() seems to requires vector arguments in the form df$var
library(dplyr) library(purrr) # Create frequency table ds_cyl_n &amp;lt;- mtcars %&amp;gt;% count(cyl) # Create custom function for use in map() my_sample_n &amp;lt;- function(x, y){ mtcars %&amp;gt;% filter(cyl == x) %&amp;gt;% sample_n( size = y, replace = TRUE ) } # hacky map map2_df(.x = ds_cyl_n$cyl, .y = ds_cyl_n$n, .f = my_sample_n) pmap() should be able to handle the dataframe as an argument but only when the column names are the same as the argument names expected by the function.</description>

      <description>When choosing where to live so many families fixate on the schools’s quality, but take a closer look at what this really measures. In CA school quality is rated on average performance. This is a “better than nothing” metric, but if you have more data on your kid (you better) then you can probably make a better informed choice, and maybe get a better deal on housing.
For instance RWC has low scores, but they have 40% ESL.</description>

      <description>reference your code from 760_bootrstrap, but your solution to resampling with map was very elegant, particularly since you overcame the nonrandom nature of sample_n when reapplied in a function.</description>

      <description>For many years I was in love with a friend, but we were never single at the same time, so it never happened. Until it did, she got out of a relationship in 2007 and I jumped out of a three-years relationship for what I thought might be my last chance. People were starting to get married by then after all.
The relatinoship did not go well. It was entirely my own fault.</description>

      <description>It is so valuable to have in your back pockket several examples of noteworthy effect sizes. These will silence the optimitsts. Realizes all reported effect sizes aer probably upper limits. Now ask could we expect an upper limit and would you be satisfied with this upper limit. It will almost certainly not be an out of the park effect, or it would be so obvious that all would have adopted it by now.</description>

      <description>Let’s do a little primer on probability. If I flip a coin, what is the probability I’ll get heads? 50%, let’s make it even easier and say 1 in 2. If I roll a die, what is the probability I’ll roll a 2? 1 in 6.
Let;s take an example of a noteworthy but subtle effect size. If women feel 1/3 of a point less included than men on a 5-pt scale with an SD of 1, what is the probability I will detect a significant difference with 30 people per cell?</description>

      <description>I used to think of planning as foresight. Now I do so much new work that it is often best to jump right in and start working. And templates and structures are designed by attrition. Use ND example of paving the dead grass in an open quad. At first just see what elements of your code you are copying and pasting. Do it three times: Make a function. Same goes for templates.</description>

      <description>[use rock rolling god pic: Sisiphus]
Experts spend more time planning than novices, who tend to jump right in and start doing. The implication is that novices should try to plan the way experts do. There is a problem with this advice: Novices (by definition) don’t know what to anticipate and thus cannot plan. You need experience in order to plan, so to become an expert, novices should start racking up experience.</description>

      <description>Overview: There are legions of git guides already on the internet. I am writing this one for my team and myself who are newly collaborating on git. I assume that other newcomers to git collaboration will find it useful. This guide will cover the basics of collaborating and undoing mistakes.
 Undoing in Git git revert The safest way to restore a previous version of your project is to use git revert 0d1d7fc32, where “0d1d7fc32” represent the hash number of the commit you want restored.</description>

      <description>My mother (like many mothers) still has an AOL account. I think her reasoning is that AOL was so difficult to learn, investing the effort to learn gmail is just too daunting. I’ll leave it at that.
If you’re not using pipes (%&amp;gt;%) in your R code, you basically have an AOL account.
The following sequences are identical in their meaning, but see which one is more human readable:
eat(butter(toast(slice(grab(bread))))) bread %&amp;gt;% grab() %&amp;gt;% slice() %&amp;gt;% toast() %&amp;gt;% butter() %&amp;gt;% eat() This is the beauty of pipes (and R generally): It let’s you think about data in a more human way.</description>
