Fracture involes the acetabulum (hip joint).  Surgical femoral head and neck osteotomy (FHO) was performed on 6/20/18.  Cat is recovering well and will continue to need limited controlled exercise for another 1-2 months.  <p></p><p></p>2)  This cat tested positive for Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV).  FIV can cause immunosuppression and susceptibility to other diseases.  Symptoms are varied but may include fever, anorexia, weight loss, or stomatitis.  Not all infected cats will become ill, and those that do may be healthy for weeks to years before illness.  Cats infected with FIV will remain infected for life and can spread the virus to other cats, usually through bite wounds.  For this reason, FIV cats should be kept indoors only, and should only be housed with FIV positive cats or in situations where risk of transmission is unlikely.  Please consult with your regular veterinarian for additional information and a management plan for your new pet.<p></p><p></p>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p></p><p></p>- Special diet or prescription foods<p></p>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p></p>- Special skin care or shampoos<p></p>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p></p>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p></p><p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>",

My previous owner let staff know that I might be more comfortable with women than men. I am very outgoing, loving, and playful.

I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p></p><p></p>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy. My caregivers have observed that I do not get along with other pets in a home. I would do best in a home with children 15+years plus.<p></p><p></p>I am one of RASKC's Rover Scholars! This means that my adoption fee is waived and my adoption comes with a $400 training scholarship. Visit the Rover Scholarship Program page (under &quot;Special Programs&quot;) to learn more!<p></p><p></p>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>",RED

An allergy is an over-reaction of the immune system to an allergen.  Allergies may affect the skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal system.  Symptoms may include itching, inflammation and hair loss, coughing, sneezing or digestive disorders.  Allergies can be caused by environmental factors, fleas or foods.  Allergies can lead to secondary problems such as skin and ear infection, or asthma.  Controlling the allergen is the best treatment.  Antihistamines, medicated shampoos, hypoallergenic diets and routine flea control are some treatment options.  We recommend that you consult with your regular veterinarian about this condition.  Continued veterinary care and additional treatment will be needed.<p></p><p></p>2)   This dog has gingival recession and worn canine teeth on the lower jaw due to chronic irritation and chewing at his skin.  He will most likely require additional dental work, possibly including extractions of the affected teeth.<p></p><p></p>3)     This dog is currenty being treated for an ear infection.  Please give all medications as prescribed.<p></p> Adoption Fee: $175.00<p></p>",GREEN

She is an 11-year-old adoptable cat currently living in a foster home. Unlike most fosters she's not in care because of her age or her health, but because of her attitude. When she first came to the shelter she was hissy and snarly and very difficult to manage. Ordinarily a cat that unfriendly to humans would be put up for adoption as a barn cat, but Gertie is front declawed and would never be able to defend herself outdoors. Her only hope was to get away from the stress of the shelter environment to see if some loving care could bring her back to the light side.<p></p><p></p>After months in foster care Gertie is a changed cat. Granted, she's still something of a curmudgeon and has definite opinions about how things ought to be, but she enjoys petting and brushing, and has a rumbling purr that she's happy to share. She is more than ready to go to her forever home, ideally where she can rule over her own private space. Gertie needs an adopter who is willing to learn her signals and respect her limits, and who appreciates that winning the heart of a &quot;difficult&quot; animal is well worth the patience it will require.

I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up.

My name is Django and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on March 20, 2018 because I needed a more low-traffic home. My previous owner was very sad to have to give me up and described me as outgoing, loving, playful and pretty much the best dog ever!<p></p><p></p>I love my people and want to be around them, cuddling and helping out with whatever tasks need to get done for the day! I have become a staff and volunteer favorite. Volunteers say I am very playful, I love my toys, and make a great walking buddy! On these nice, sunny summer days, who wouldn't want to take me home and take a walk or jog with me: I'm great on leash!<p></p><p></p>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other large dogs, but can be noisy when saying hello between a fence or gate. I would do best meeting any potential dog friends at the shelter before going home. (I have a big personality!) When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p></p><p></p>My ideal home would be low traffic and with adults only. My previous owners let staff know that loud noises and lots of commotion makes me very uneasy and does not always bring out my best side. However, while in the shelter, I have done great with the positive and gentle approach that my caregivers have taken.<p></p><p></p>I am one of RASKC's Rover Scholars! This means that my adoption fee is waived and my adoption comes with a $400 training scholarship. Visit the Rover Scholarship Program page (under &quot;Special Programs&quot;) to learn more!<p></p><p></p>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>",RED

She is one of the larger kittens like Winston her brother, the other two are smaller in size and will be ready for adoption in a few weeks.<p></p>So, about Cece, she is full of vim and vigor and has a good measure of kitten curiosity. She has good manners, uses the cat box, eats all her dinner and other meals too. She likes to run around the house and get into anything you leave out; play time with you will be her favorite time though. One of the things I like the most about her is she starts purring as soon as you pick her up, she is so sweet a great lap kitten. <p></p>So, if meeting her is on your list of things to get done, give me Tracy her foster person a call at 206 242-7659 for a time to come by.<p></p><p></p>Adoption Fee: An Adoption Fee has not been set.
